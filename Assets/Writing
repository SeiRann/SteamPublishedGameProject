 

1. Core Concept 

a short psychological thriller (1.5–2 hours) centered around themes of order, hierarchy, intellectual arrogance, and manipulation. The story follows a freelance archaeologist who believes civilizations collapse when structure weakens. He is not chosen because he is special  he is chosen because he already thinks like the system that seeks to use him. 

2. Protagonist 

Name: William Clark 

Age: 30–35 

Profession: Independent explorer / freelance archaeologist / documentary researcher 
 
 

Personality Traits 

- Curious, borderline obsessive 

- Skeptical of mysticism but fascinated by symbolism 

- Calm exterior masking internal anxiety 

- Speaks rarely, writes constantly 

- Needs evidence, not belief 

Motivation 

For years, he has investigated pyramid structures missing from official records, sites erased from archives, and locations locals refuse to discuss. His academic papers were rejected. Funding was withdrawn. This expedition is not heroic, it is his final attempt to prove he was right. 

3. The Theory of Structural Order 

He argues that civilizations do not collapse due to invasion or disaster, but when social structure becomes negotiable. He sees the pyramid not as architecture, but as the perfect model of societal balance. 

Three-Tier Structural Model 

1. The Foundation – The Majority (laborers and executors; stability through repetition) 

2. The Middle Layer – Administrators (priests, scribes; preserve ideology and structure) 

3. The Apex – The Architect (rare, often invisible; maintains equilibrium) 
 
 

He believes hierarchy is not oppression, but structural necessity. When roles blur and mobility destabilizes the system, collapse becomes inevitable. 

4. The Letter 

Weeks before the expedition, he receives an anonymous package containing a handwritten letter and coordinates. 

 

Full Letter Text: 
 
 

You have spent years studying structures that were erased. 
 
You were correct about the missing registries. 
About the sites that 'never existed.' 
 
There is one more. 
 
A structure that does not appear in any archive. 
Because it was never meant to be found twice. 
 
The coordinates are enclosed. 
 
The apex is not above. 
If you enter, do not look back. 
 
You believe order preserves civilizations. 
 
You are about to witness what preserves order. 
 
 

The letter is unsigned. 
 
 

5. Symbols in the Letter (Later Revealed as Warnings) 

- Inverted Triangle with a Dot               The apex lies below; authority is underground. 

- Backward-Facing Eye                              Observation is reciprocal; something watches when you look back. 

- Balanced Scale                                             Judgment is already active. 

- Closed Spiral                                                  The cycle repeats; time is recursive. 

The player cannot decipher these symbols at the beginning. Throughout the game, they reappear in carvings and ritual chambers, revealing that the letter was a warning from the protagonist’s future self.

Prologue  The Hotel Office 

  

The game begins in his Egypt hotel room, converted into a research office. Players explore maps, rejected papers, and obsessive notes on structural theory. 
 
 

 

REJECTED PAPER #1 

Title: “Structural Permanence and the Myth of Civilizational Collapse” 

Stamped in red: 
REJECTED  Insufficient Evidence 

Excerpt (Visible to Player): 

The long-standing academic consensus attributes the decline of dynastic Egypt to invasion, economic instability, and environmental change. 

This interpretation ignores a more fundamental cause: structural permeability. 

Egyptian civilization did not fall when it was attacked. 
It faltered when social roles became negotiable. 

Stability is not moral. 
It is architectural. 

Reviewer Comment (Attached): 

The argument borders on deterministic authoritarianism. 
Correlation does not imply structural causation. 
The paper lacks archaeological grounding for its philosophical claims. 

Handwritten Note by Protagonist (angry pen pressure): 

They reduce structure to politics. 
They refuse to see pattern. 

  

REJECTED PAPER #2 

Title: “Hieroglyphic Systems as Behavioral Architecture” 

Stamped: 
DECLINED  Speculative 

  

Excerpt: 

Hieroglyphs have been studied as religious, decorative, or linguistic artifacts. 

What if they were something else? 

What if repeated symbols functioned as cognitive reinforcement mechanisms — 
a way to stabilize collective behavior across generations? 

Repetition builds compliance. 
Symbol builds structure. 

  

Reviewer Comment: 

The claim that hieroglyphic repetition shaped social behavior at scale is unsupported and ventures into sociological conjecture. 

  

His Handwritten Addition: 

They assume religion was irrational. 
It was design. 

  

PERSONAL NOTEBOOK FRAGMENTS  

  

Page 12 

The pyramid is not symbolic of power. 
It is the only shape that distributes weight without collapse. 

Wide base. Narrow command. 

It is not oppression. 
It is geometry. 

  

Page 17 

If a civilization collapses, it means equilibrium was lost. 
Equilibrium cannot be lost accidentally. 

Either it erodes slowly… 

Or it is removed. 

(Underlined three times: Removed) 

  

Page 21 

There are references across Mesopotamia and Egypt to “the Weigher.” 
Not a god of mercy. 
A god of measurement. 

Measurement implies threshold. 
Threshold implies correction. 

  

Page 26 (More Unstable Tone) 

What if collapse is maintenance? 
What if reset is intentional? 

History does not drift. 
It adjusts. 

MAP NOTES ON THE WALL 

Pinned map of Egypt. 

Red circles drawn around empty desert areas. 

Small writing beside one circle: 

Missing registry entry 1897. 
Cross-reference suppressed. 

Another: 

Local avoidance pattern. 
No economic incentive for absence. 
Fear-based? 

  

OPTIONAL SMALL DETAIL  

On the desk: 
A small sketch of a pyramid. 

But he has drawn the apex below ground. 

  

  

Entering the Ruins 

Inside the pyramid, carvings show a civilization built on collective learning. Leaders teach instead of rule. Knowledge flows freely. Gods observe rather than dominate. 

The protagonist interprets this as validation of his Structural Order theory: they were not ruled  they were organized. 

Escape from the Cult – Turning Point 

Captured and dragged toward an altar, the protagonist awakens mid-transport. He strangles the cultist leading him. This decisive act reveals his will. 

Thoth recognizes his ideological alignment: he believes in structure, hierarchy, and correction. He is not passive. He is useful. 

Deeper Exploration – The Truth Shifts 

Further inside, the carvings reveal the civilization’s prosperity: minimal disease, rare conflict, intellectual advancement. 

However, darker inscriptions appear: 'The Unworthy cloud the collective mind.' 'Sacrifice is purification of imbalance.' 

The gods did not demand blind worship they demanded intellectual purity. 

 

Revelation 

In a hidden chamber, the protagonist uncovers inscriptions in Thoth’s voice: 

'Others never believed in human potential. I did. I gave them knowledge. I made them stable. I made them prosper. They should not worship me. I built them so they could thrive. If I benefit from their devotion… is that injustice?' 

Thoth elevated the civilization but required sacrifices of the 'ignorant.' He consumed their souls, storing their intellectual essence as energy to eventually break into physical existence. 

 

The Fall of the Civilization 

Over time, the civilization reached intellectual stagnation. Breakthroughs ceased. Energy flow slowed. The paradise decayed. 

Now only a small cult remains descendants continuing sacrifices to revive the golden age, unaware they are merely sustaining Thoth’s emergence. 

Confronting the Cult 

The protagonist enters a ritual chamber filled with blood, artifacts of victims, and carved names. 

The Scribe declares: 'We preserve the worthy. We remove the noise.' 

Using powers granted by Thoth, the protagonist executes the Scribe and the cultists, believing he is freeing sacrificed souls. 

Instead, the mass release of stored energy transfers directly to Thoth. The cult was not only worshippers  they were containment. Because he is using Thoth’s powers, he is considered scribe and because of that the energy is transfered to Thoth. 

Exiting the Pyramid 

As he exits, the sky darkens. A vast ibis-like silhouette forms in the clouds. 

Back in his apartment, he looks through the window. The presence is real. Physical. 

By dismantling the cult, he removed the final anchor. He freed the god who engineered the system. 

Thematic Conclusion 

The protagonist believed hierarchy was necessary. By violently replacing the Scribe and enforcing his own correction, he unknowingly became the Apex  even if only briefly. 

The cult was consistent. Thoth was ideological. The protagonist was arrogant. The player believed they did good  until the sky darkened. 

 

7. Endings 

Ending 1 – Refusal: 

He refuses to complete the symbol. The pyramid destabilizes. Cut to hotel room. The letter remains, but the symbols are gone. 

 

Ending 2 – Acceptance: 

He completes the symbol. Cut to hotel room. He writes the same letter and draws the same symbols. He sends the package to himself
